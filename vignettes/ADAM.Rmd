# Overview
*ADAMgui* is an Graphical User Interface  for the ADAM package which is
GSEA R package created to group a set of genes from comparative samples 
(control *versus* experiment) belonging to different species according to
their respective functions (Gene Ontology and KEGG pathways as default) 
and show their significance by calculating p-values referring to gene
diversity and activity (@Castro2009). Each group of genes is called GFAG 
(Group of Functionally Associated Genes). 

 The ADAM package was constituted by an 
statistical class, all genes present in the expression data are 
grouped by their respective functions according to the domains described by 
AnalysisDomain argument. The relationship between genes and functions are made
based on the species annotation package. If there is no annotation package, 
a three column file (gene, function and function description) must be provided.
For each GFAG, gene diversity and activity in each sample are calculated. As the
package allways compare two samples (control *versus* experiment), relative gene
diversity and activity for each GFAG are calculated. Using bootstrap method,
for each GFAG, according to relative gene diversity and activity, two p-values
are calculated. The p-values are then corrected, according to the correction
method defined by PCorrectionMethod argument, generating a q-value (@molan2018). 
The significative GFAGs will be those whoose q-value stay under the cutoff set
by PCorrection argument. Optionally, it's possible to run Wilcoxon test and/or 
Fisher's exact test (@fontoura2016). These tests also provide a corrected
p-value, and siginificative groups can be seen through them.

The ADAMgui package provides a graphical class so the outputs of the statistical 
functions in the ADAM package  can be studied through different plots. 
It's possible, for example, to choose a specific GFAG and observe the gene 
expression behavior within it. Features as differential expression and fold
change can be easily seen.

# Graphical User Interface (GUI)
The ADAMgui package contains 2 graphical modules for visualization and analysis of 
the GFAGAnalysis output file. These modules are shiny-generated (GUI)s that
allows the user to create and download plots in .eps format. The functions that
launches those applications are: GFAGpathUi() and GFAGtargetUi(). The sections
bellow contains more information about both applications.

## GFAG Path Viewer Function: GFAGpathUi()
'Paths' are essentially group names that contains the targets (eg: Gene
Ontologies and KEGG are paths while genes and proteins related to them 
are targets). The GFAGAnalysis output file contains information about the paths
that the user utilized in the analysis and the GFAGpathUi() is a function that
launches a shiny based (GUI) that can construct heatmaps for q-values present in
the GFAGAnalysis output file. Bellow there is the layout of an usage example of
the application with the GFAGAnalysis output file created with the first 10
entries of the *Aedes Aegypt* data used in the statistical modules. 

To generate the input file 'ResultAnalysisAedes.txt' use the commands on R 
console listed bellow. First load the data in the package:
```{r eval=TRUE, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
library(ADAMgui)
data("ResultAnalysisAedes")
```

Then select the first 10 rows:
```{r eval=TRUE, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
library(ADAMgui)
data("ResultAnalysisAedes")
dt<-ResultAnalysisAedes[1:10,]
```
And save it:
```{r eval=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
write.table(dt,'ResultAnalysisAedes.txt',sep='\t',quote = F,
    row.names = F,col.names = T)
```

Now launch the app, it can be launched in local machine or your default browser:
```{r eval=TRUE, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
library(ADAMgui)
```

```{r eval=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
 GFAGpathUi(TRUE)  #Run the app in your default browser.
 GFAGpathUi(FALSE) #Run the app in R (your local machine).
```

## GFAG Target Viewer Function: GFAGtargetUi()

This application was made to further analyse the GFAGs in the GFAGAnalysis
output file. These paths can have many targets (genes, proteins) and this
application constructs a plot that show the differential expression of the
targets in a selected Path. The user needs to input 4 files in order to use this
application: the GFAGAnalysis output file, an expression file, a Path-to-Target 
relationship file and a differential expression file.

Bellow there is the layout of an usage example of the application with the
GFAGAnalysis output file of the *Aedes Aegypt* data used in the
statistical modules. Load the required data first in order to generate
the input data:

```{r eval=TRUE, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
library(ADAM)
```

```{r eval=TRUE, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
data("ResultAnalysisAedes") # GFAG Output data
```

```{r eval=TRUE, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
data("ExpressionAedes") # target expression data
```

```{r eval=TRUE, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
data("GeneFunctionAedes") # Path-to-Target relationship data
```

```{r eval=TRUE, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
data("DiffAedes") # target differential expression
```

Now create the files:

```{r eval=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}

# save the GFAG output file
write.table(dt,'ResultAnalysisAedes.txt',sep='\t',quote = F,
    row.names = F,col.names = T)

# save the target expression file
write.table(dt,'ExpressionAedes.txt',sep='\t',quote = F,
    row.names = F,col.names = T)

# save the Path-to-Target relationship file
write.table(dt,'GeneFunctionAedes.txt',sep='\t',quote = F,
    row.names = F,col.names = T)

# save the target differential expression file
write.table(dt,'DiffAedes.txt',sep='\t',quote = F,
    row.names = F,col.names = T)
```

The app can be launched in local machine or your default browser:

```{r eval=TRUE, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
library(ADAMgui)
```

```{r eval=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
GFAGtargetUi(TRUE)  #Run the app in your default browser.
GFAGtargetUi(FALSE) #Run the app in R (your local machine).
```

*  <div style="text-align: justify"> **4** - 
**Tab 1: Path-to-Target Data** . This element is initially disabled, the user

**Tab 1:Target Differential Expression Data** . This element is initially
disabled, the user needs to correctly upload a GFAGAnalysis output file, a

differential expression file of interest. Note that this package does not 
supports differential expression analysis. The user needs to make the analysis 
by other means and input the results in the correct format. Because of this, 
once a file is uploaded a menu containing reading parameters and column
selection elements will be displayed in this field. The columns to be selected
are respectively: the column the contains the target's ID, the column that
contains the logFC (log Fold Change) values and a the column that contains the
p-values or q-values. No control can implemented here, so if the user input the
wrong columns in the fields, the resulting plot will be wrong. Should this
happen the user needs to reset the application by clicking on **6**.</div>
