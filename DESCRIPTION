Description: ADAMgui is a Graphical User Interface for the ADAM package. The 
    ADAMgui package provides 2 shiny-based applications that allows the user to 
    study the output of the ADAM package files through different plots. It's 
    possible, for example, to choose a specific GFAG and observe the gene 
    expression behavior with the plots created with the GFAGtargetUi function.
    Features such as differential expression and foldchange can be easily seen 
    with aid of the plots made with GFAGpathUi function.
